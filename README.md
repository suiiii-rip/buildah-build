Buildah is a GitHub Action for building Docker and Kubernetes-compatible images quickly and easily.

Buildah only works on Linux. GitHub's [Ubuntu Environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments#available-environments) (`ubuntu-18.04` and newer) come with buildah installed. If you are not using these environments, or if you want to use a different version, you must first [install buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/install.md).

After building your image, use [push-to-registry](https://github.com/redhat-actions/push-to-registry) to push the image and make it pullable.

    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>base-image</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>The base image to use to create the initial container. If not specified, the action will try to pick one automatically. (N.B: At this time the action is only able to auto select Java base image)</td>

    <td>No</td>
    <td>The list of Dockerfile paths to perform a build using docker instructions. This is a multiline input to allow multiple Dockerfiles.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>oci</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>
      Build the image using the OCI format, instead of the Docker format.<br>
      By default, this is <code>false</code>, because images built using the OCI format have <a href="https://github.com/docker/hub-feedback/issues/1871">issues</a> when published to Dockerhub.

## Build Types

You can configure the `buildah` action to build your image using one or more Dockerfiles, or none at all.

### Building using Dockerfiles

If you have been building your images with an existing Dockerfile, `buildah` can reuse your Dockerfile.

In this case the inputs needed are `image` and `dockerfiles`. `tag` is also recommended. If your Dockerfile requires ARGs, these can be passed using `build-arg`.

```yaml
name: Build Image using Dockerfile
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Buildah Action
      uses: redhat-actions/buildah-build@v1
      with:
        image: my-new-image
        tag: v1
        dockerfiles: |
          ./Dockerfile
        build-args: |
          some_arg=some_value
```

### Building without a Dockerfile

Building without a Dockerfile requires additional inputs, that would normally be specified in the Dockerfile.

Do not set `dockerfiles` if you are doing a build from scratch. Otherwise those Dockerfiles will be used, and the inputs below will be ignored.

- An output `image` name and usually a `tag`.
- `base-image`
  - In a Dockerfile, this would be the `FROM` directive.
- `content` to copy into the new image
  - In a Dockerfile, this would be `COPY` directives.
- `entrypoint` so the container knows what command to run.
  - In a Dockerfile, this would be the `ENTRYPOINT`.
- All other optional configuration inputs, such as `port`, `envs`, and `workdir`.

Example of building a Spring Boot Java app image:
```yaml
name: Build Image
on: [push]

jobs:
  build-image:
    name: Build image
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - run: mvn package

    - name: Build Image
      uses: redhat-actions/buildah-build@v1
      with:
        base-image: docker.io/fabric8/java-alpine-openjdk11-jre
        image: my-new-image
        tag: v1
        content: |
          target/spring-petclinic-2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
        entrypoint: java -jar spring-petclinic-2.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
        port: 8080
```

## Using private images
If your build requires a private image, you have to `docker login` in a step before running this action.

For example:
```yaml
- name: Log in to Red Hat Registry
  run: echo "${{ secrets.REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_PASSWORD }}" | docker login registry.redhat.io -u "${{ secrets.REGISTRY_REDHAT_IO_USER }}" --password-stdin
```
